The goal of this project is to combine the ROS1 ( Robot Operating System ) framework with the messaging protocol MQTT to enable ROS1 for multi robot cloud services.

- ROS messages get converted to JSON Objects with the soss-json package
- MQTT client detects if payload is JSON or MessagePack
- Format of out-going message can be configured system-wide and per interface
- ROS topics are mapped to MQTT topics 1:1
- ROS services have a dynamic mapping to differentiate services clients and requests
- Request: <SERVICE>/request/<UUID>/<COUNTER> (Wildcard/server: <SERVICE>/request/#)
- Response: <SERVICE>/response/<UUID>/<COUNTER> (Wildcard/client: <SERVICE>/response/<UUID>/#)
- Server can handle any reference pattern (instead of <UUID>/<COUNTER>)

## Package overview
- **soss-mqtt (plugin)**
    - MQTT v3 (v5 would be possible)
    - SSL support
    - User/password authentication
    - Plan JSON (text) or MessagePack (binary)
    - Topics and Services
- **mqtt-client (executable)**
    - Automatic configuration for ROS1 and/or ROS2
    - Runs SOSS with plugins
    - Automatic prefixing (optional)
- **mqtt-client-ros1 (example)**
    - Depends on soss-ros1 and std_msgs/srvs
- **mqtt-client-ros2 (example)**
    - Depends on soss-ros2 and std_msgs/srvs
    
## Development
### Build mqtt-client-ros1

- **Install dependencies**
    - sudo apt install libboost-program-options-dev libyaml-cpp-dev libssl-dev
    - sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
- **Create catkin workspace (example: ~/soss_ws/)**
    - mkdir –p ~/soss_ws/src
- **Clone the contents of this archive into ~/soss_ws/src**
    - cd ~/soss_ws/src
    - git clone https://github.com/telekom/mrcs.git
- **Clone upstream dependencies**
    - cd ~/soss_ws/src
    - git clone https://github.com/ipa-mdl/soss_v2.git
    - git clone https://github.com/ipa-mdl/soss-ros1.git
- **Build (example: ROS1 noetic)**
    - cd ~/soss_ws
    - . /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
    - colcon build --packages-up-to mqtt-client-ros1
    
### Running the mqtt-client
Run these steps in different terminals:

- Install and start mosquito MQTT broker
    - sudo apt install mosquitto
    - mosquitto
        - if this step shows `Error: Address already in use` then it is possible that the broker is already running
- Monitor all MQTT messages
    - sudo apt install mosquitto-clients
    - mosquitto_sub -v -t '#'
- Start ROS master
    - . /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
    - roscore
- Start mqtt-client with test configuration (needs “test” scope)
    - cd ~/soss_ws
    - . install/setup.bash
    - mqtt-client --address localhost --scope test src/mrcs/mqtt-client/test/client.yml
    
### Testing the mqtt-client
Run these steps in different terminals:
- Publish to ROS topic
    - . /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
    - rostopic pub /out std_msgs/String "data: 'hello-world'" -r 1
- Subscribe to ROS topic
    - . /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
    - rostopic echo /in
- Start test service (“local_service”, std_srvs/Trigger)
    - cd ~/soss_ws
    - . install/setup.bash
    - python3 src/mrcs/mqtt-client/test/service1.py
- Call test service
    - . /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
    - rosservice call /remote_service
